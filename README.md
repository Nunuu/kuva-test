Start the development server:

```bash

```

To build the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## List of Improvements

1. Initiated project using personal [React Starterkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nunuu/react-starterkit) with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier support.
2. Added concurrently & json-server as devDependencies instead of dependencies
3. Created top bar with avatar dropdown and darkmode toggle
4. Created functioning image carousel

## Recommendations

1. Minimize image sizes

- use vector based SVGs when possible
- avoid using PNGs unless a transparent background is needed

## Questions

1. What is an image metadata? What properties should be displayed?
